## Welcome to Vilnius

This purpose of this project is to measure the distance between selected points clicked on the map, and to store the coordinates of the points and the total distance in a redux store.

### Required Criteria

*Fullscreen map usable on Chrome (2019 and 2020 releases).
*Center Vilnius in the center of the map with an appropriate zoom level.
*Use a nice map style.
*Implement a click event like in https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/measure/ to
measure distance between all points in total.
*Each click on the map should draw another point which is connected to the previous points
(as in the given example above).
*You must use redux to receive and store the array of point coordinates and the total
distance on each click.
*Use the metric system with meters to display the distance.
*As a redux store please use console.log(), so that each click produces a store event, which is
send to the console (intercepting the click and directly sending to console is not valid; you
must use redux for this exercise here).



### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
